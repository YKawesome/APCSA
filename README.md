<p>Hello World! This is all of my work for my high school AP Computer Science A class. I tried to go above and beyond with each of the projects, each better than the last.</p>
<h2>Hello World</h2>
<p>This is where my very first java programs in this course were written.</p>
<h2>Beginning Class Work</h2>
<p>This is where my training for java started in the classroom, learning many basic aspects of Java to be utilized later.</p>
<h2>Hotel</h2>
<p>This was a mini-project where I had to fill a a hotel with n floors and k rooms per floor with specific naming criteria. This heavily built my understanding of arrays and loops.</p>
<h2>Pong</h2>
<p>This was my first large-scale project. I had to recreate the retro pong game with two paddles and a ball. I included a powerup that, when collected, would make the paddle move faster. This project built my understanding of working with graphics and methods that update repeatedly, using the GDV5 Module. I also created methods to autonomously play the game for demonstration.</p>
<h2>Breakout</h3>
<p>This was my second large-scale project. I was tasked with recreating Atari Breakout, with a paddle hitting a ball into bricks. I added several powerups including multiball and created 2D arrays of color palettes so that user customization could be improved. Once again, I made an "AI" to control the paddle for demonstration purposes.</p>
<h2>Snake</h2>
<p>This was my third large-scale project, and it's where my programming prowess started to shine. I was able to make progress extremely quickly, utilizing the ArrayList library to make a snake that continued to expand. In addition to this, I created several "fruits" to be consumed that increased snake length by different amounts. Finally, I used background music, custom sound effects from friends which I converted to .wav files, and a sprite that acted as my splash front page.</p>
<h2>!Battleship</h2>
<p>This was my fourth large-scale project. It is as it says; not Battleship. It's a war game where every type of ship has its own movement patterns, attack types, vision, strength, health, and more. The amount of customization here necessitated a lot of time spent on programming, which luckily wasn't too difficult. In addition, I learned about Abstract classes and Interfaces, and utilized both in my program to create the Boat Class (abstract) and Attacker Interface.</p>
